## server

The back-end code lives within this folder. This side of the project utilizes a framework called [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest), or Nest.js. Nest.js is described by itself as:

> Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

> Under the hood, Nest makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like Express (the default) and optionally can be configured to use Fastify as well!

> Nest provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify), but also exposes their APIs directly to the developer. This gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party modules which are available for the underlying platform.

This was built using the non-strict typescript starter template as defined from [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps).
The below contents are simplified from the default starter to focus more on usage.

## Project folder structure

The general structure follows this blog post:
https://encore.dev/articles/nestjs-project-structure-best-practices

I already added a few modules (not the project modules, but rather the NestJS module).

### Note about empty dto, entities and core/db folders?

These folders are empty but will be filled as a followup with sqlite onboarding.

Following the pattern mentioned here in the article being followed for guidance:

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
